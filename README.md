# Claude Code Plugin Marketplace Template

A template for creating your own Claude Code plugin marketplace — a shared repository where teams can publish, discover, and install plugins.

## Quick Start

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own marketplace repository
2. Name your new repository (e.g., `my-org/dev-plugins`)
3. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with your name, org, and description
4. Start creating plugins with `/new-plugin`

## What's Included

This template comes with built-in tooling to get you productive immediately:

- **Plugin generator script** (`bin/generate-plugin.sh`) — scaffolds a new plugin with all the right directories and files
- **`/new-plugin` command** — create plugins directly from Claude Code
- **Skill authoring guide** (`.claude/skills/create-skill/`) — reference for writing well-structured skills
- **Contributing guide template** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) — ready to customize for your team

## Customization Checklist

After creating your repository from this template, update the following:

- [ ] Update `marketplace.json` with your name and repository
- [ ] Update this `README.md` for your marketplace
- [ ] Update the default author in `bin/generate-plugin.sh`
- [ ] Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` for your contribution policy
- [ ] Update or replace the `LICENSE` for your needs
- [ ] Delete this checklist once done

## For Teams

A plugin marketplace helps teams:

- **Reduce duplication** — share solutions across teams instead of reinventing them
- **Spread best practices** — codify conventions in plugins everyone can use
- **Continuous improvement** — tooling gets better as people contribute enhancements
- **Low friction adoption** — easy for team members to discover and install useful tools
