# Plugin Marketplace

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace distributed via `extraKnownMarketplaces` in consuming projects' `settings.json`.

## Versioning is automated

Plugin versions are bumped automatically by CI from scoped Conventional
Commits — **do not edit `version` fields by hand**.

### Commit messages

Use Conventional Commits with the **plugin directory name** as the scope:

```
feat(my-plugin): add a new skill                 → minor bump for my-plugin
fix(my-plugin): handle missing config gracefully → patch bump for my-plugin
refactor(my-plugin)!: rename a command           → major bump for my-plugin
chore(deps): bump prettier                       → no plugin release
ci: tweak validate workflow                      → no plugin release
```

Rules enforced in CI:
- Scope must match an existing `plugins/<name>/` directory (`commitlint`).
- One commit must not touch more than one `plugins/<name>/` subtree
  (`bin/check-plugin-scope.sh`). Split cross-plugin changes into separate
  commits.
- Shared/infra changes (`bin/`, `.github/`, top-level docs) use unscoped
  types (`ci:`, `chore:`, `docs:`) and never trigger a release.

### What gets bumped

When a scoped commit lands on `main`, `release.yml` runs `semantic-release` for
that plugin and updates all three version locations in one commit:

1. `plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
2. The matching entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `plugins[]`
3. The top-level `version` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
   (patch on normal release; minor when the plugin's first-ever release runs)

Each plugin gets its own tag namespace (`<plugin>-v<semver>`) and a GitHub
Release.

### Required setup

For `release.yml` to push commits and tags back to `main`, add a repository
secret named `RELEASE_TOKEN` with a fine-grained PAT (or GitHub App token)
that has `contents: write` on this repo. The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be
used because pushes from it do not retrigger workflows.

## Schema Validation

**After editing any `plugin.json` or `marketplace.json`**, run:
```bash
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin validate plugins/<plugin-name>
```

A pre-commit hook runs `claude plugin validate` automatically when manifest
files are staged (installed by `bin/install-hooks.sh`, which runs on
SessionStart). The same validation runs in CI via
`.github/workflows/validate.yml`.

## Updating in Consuming Projects

After a version bump publishes, users in consuming projects must run:
```
/plugin update <plugin>@<your-marketplace>
```

If the plugin appears stale despite updating, clear the local cache:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache
```
